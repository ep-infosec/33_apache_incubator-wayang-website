Data  analytics  are  moving  beyond  the  limits  of  a single data processing platform. A cross-platform query optimizer is necessary to enable applications to run their tasks over multiple platforms  efficiently  and  in  a  platform-agnostic  manner.  For the  optimizer  to  be  effective,  it  must  consider  data  movement costs  across  different  data  processing  platforms.  In  this  paper,we  present  the  graph-based  data  movement  strategy  used  by RHEEM, our open-source cross-platform system. In particular, we(i) model the data movement problem as a new graph problem,which  we  prove  to  be  NP-hard,  and  (ii)  propose  a  novel  graph exploration algorithm, which allows RHEEMto discover multiple hidden  opportunities  for  cross-platform  data  processing
