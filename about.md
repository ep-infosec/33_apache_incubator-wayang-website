Apache Wayang has a three-layer data processing abstraction that sits between user applications and data processing platforms, such as Hadoop and Spark. The figure below depicts the Apache Wayang architecture: (i) an application layer that models all application-specific logic; (ii) a core layer that provides the intermediate representation between applications and processing platforms; and (iii) a platform layer that embraces the underlying processing platforms. Overall, the input of an application layer comprises the logical operators provided by users (or generated by a declarative query parser) and the output is a physical plan (WayangPlan). The WayangPlan is then passed to the core layer where cross-platform optimizations take place to produce an execution plan (ExecutionPlan).<br><br> Notice that, in contrast to DBMSs, Apache Wayang decouples physical and execution levels. This separation allows applications to express physical plans in terms of algorithmic needs only, without being tied to a particular processing platform. The salient features of Apache Wayang are cross-platform task execution, high-performance, flexibility, and ease-of-use.
