- title: Cross platform enablement
  icon: fas fa-bezier-curve
  description-short: Run data analytics tasks on top of any set of data processing platforms.
  description: |
    The most salient feature of Apache Wayang is its cross platform optimizer. Besides deciding the best processing platform to run any incoming task, Apache Wayang can run a single task on multiple processing platforms. Overall, it applies an extensible set of graph transformations to the Apache Wayang plan to find alternative better execution plans. After it compares all execution plans by using a platform-specific cost model. Cost functions can either be given or learned, and are parameterized with respect to the underlying hardware (e.g., number of computing nodes for distributed operators).

- title: High Efficiency
  icon: fa fa-clock
  description-short: Apache Wayang selects the best available data processing platform for any incoming query.
  description: |
    Apache Wayang provides a number of optimized operators and novel query optimization processes that allows to efficiently deal with big (as well as small) datasets. Furthermore, as the data processing abstraction is based on UDFs, Apache Wayang lets applications expose semantic properties about their functions, optimization hints (e.g., numbers of iterations), constraints (e.g., physical collocation of operators), and alternative plans. The optimizer then uses those artifacts where available in a best-effort approach.

- title: Flexibility
  icon: fa fa-puzzle-piece
  description-short: User defined functions (UDFs) as first-class citizens, enabling extensibility and adaptability.
  description: |
    Apache Wayang provides a set of operators, which applications use to specify their tasks. The key aspect of Apache Wayang is the providing of a flexible operator mapping structure; allowing developers to add, modify, or delete mappings among Wayang and execution operators. As a result, developers can also add or remove Wayang and execution operators.

- title: Easy to use
  icon: fas fa-child
  description-short: Apache Wayang provides a simple interface to enable developers to focus on the logics of their applications.
  description: |
    Apache Wayang exposes a simple Java API to developers whereby they can implement their tasks. Developers focus on the logics of their tasks rather than on low-level details specific to data processing platforms. The figure of the SGD plans above shows the Wayang plan for a scalable gradient descent implementation: we clearly see that this tedious implementation task is now much easier!

- title: Cost Saving
  icon: fa fa-piggy-bank
  description-short: Fast development of data analytics applications, reduces sunken costs and enables innovation
  description: |
    Users do not have to know the intricacies of the underlying platforms: they focus on the logic of their application only. This not only speeds up the development of applications, but also it is no longer a "must have" to be an expert in big data infrastructures. Apache Wayang takes care of how and on which data processing platforms fits best for the given tasks to deploy applications.

- title: Open Source
